# Who am I

I'm Martin Perez Torrents, I'm from Oviedo (Asturias).
Currently I'm working as a mechanical engineer in a company in Sant Cugat and, as engineer I have contact with data analysis but from the user view.

# Why am I here

I always wanted to learn some coding language but the options I found were always, or to small like mooc courses or too long term like university degrees or master. Ironhack offer a course with deep learning that doesn't requires previous knowledge in coding.

In this course I expect to learn, especially, coding with Python, using databases and the basics of machine learning.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

That's the tricky question, on one hand I want to try to work as a data engineer but, on the other hand, I don't want to lay aside my current carreer as mechanical engineer. I guess that, along the course, I will discover my preferences or which possibilities do I have with my skills.
